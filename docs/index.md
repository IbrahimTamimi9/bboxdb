# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of BBoxDB. BBoxDB is a research project to evaluate a novel database architecture for multi-dimensional big data. BBoxDB is designed as a distributed system, new nodes can be added to process larger amounts of data.

In contrast to traditional key-value stores, BBoxDB is able to handle multi-dimensional data. The data is placed into an n-dimensional space and parts of the space are handleded by differnet nodes.
