This page shows, how to embed the BBoxDB client into your project and how to set up a connection to a BBoxDB cluster. Since BBoxDB is listed in the central maven repository, you can simple add BBoxDB by using maven.

### Integrating with Maven
To add the BBoxDB client to your project, add the following lines to your `pom.xml`. All needed dependencies are automatically added to your project. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bboxdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>bboxdb</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### Creating your first client
To connect to a BBoxDB cluster, you need to know two things: 

* The endpoints of your Zookeeper installation
* The name of the cluster

This information can be used to create a new object of type `BBoxDBCluster`:

```java
// The name of the cluster
final String clustername = "mycluster";
	
// The zookeeper connection points
final List<String> connectPoints = Arrays.asList("node1:2181", "node2:2181");

// Connect to the server
final BBoxDB bboxdbClient = new BBoxDBCluster(connectPoints, clustername);
```

After the object is created, the connection to the cluster can be established and tested:

```java
bboxdbClient.connect();
		
// Check the connection state
if (! bboxdbClient.isConnected()) {
	System.out.println("Error while connecting to the BBoxDB cluster");
	System.exit(-1);
}
```

Notice: You will find a full working example for the _BBoxDB Client_ [here](https://github.com/jnidzwetzki/bboxdb/tree/master/examples).
