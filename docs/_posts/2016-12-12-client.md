This page shows, how to embed the BBoxDB client into your project and how to set up a connection to a BBoxDB cluster. Since BBoxDB is listed in the central maven repository, you can simple add BBoxDB by using maven.

### Integrating with Maven
To add the BBoxDB client to your project, add the following lines to your `pom.xml`. All needed dependencies are automatically added to your project. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bboxdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>bboxdb</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### Creating your first client



Notice: You will find a full working example for the _BBoxDB Client_ [here](https://github.com/jnidzwetzki/bboxdb/tree/master/examples).
