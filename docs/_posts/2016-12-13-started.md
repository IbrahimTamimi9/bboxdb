# An Example with OpenStreetmap Data
This section covers an example to demonstrate the basic functionality of BBoxDB. Data of the OpenStreetmap project is fechted, converted and imported into a table. Then, some queries are executed on this data set. In this example, the spatial data of Germany is used. Then, all trees around the famous [Alexanderplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz) (a public square in Berlin) are fetched.

## Viewing the discovered BBoxDB instances
Before the data is imported, it is useful to verify that all started instances of BBoxDB are discovered and ready. This task can be done via the 'show_instances' action of the CLI.

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action show_instances
Connecting to BBoxDB cluster... [Established]
Show all discovered BBoxDB instances

#######
DistributedInstance [ip=192.168.1.181, port=50505, version=0.3.1, state=READY]
DistributedInstance [ip=192.168.1.189, port=50505, version=0.3.1, state=READY]
DistributedInstance [ip=192.168.1.192, port=50505, version=0.3.1, state=READY]
DistributedInstance [ip=192.168.1.199, port=50505, version=0.3.1, state=READY]
DistributedInstance [ip=192.168.1.202, port=50505, version=0.3.0, state=UNKNOWN]
#######
```

In our example, the cluster consists of 5 BBoxDB instances. The instances on the first four systems are ready. The instance of the system 192.168.1.202 is not available at the moment.

## Downloading and Converting Data
The first step is to download and to convert the data set. The data is stored in a format called 'Protocolbuffer Binary Format'. BBoxDB ships with a converter that converts this format into GeoJSON. You will find more details about the data converter [here](/bboxdb/tools/converter.html).

The conversion can be executed with the following commands:
```bash
$ wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany-latest.osm.pbf
$ cd $BBOXDB_HOME
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/osm_data_conveter.sh -input /path/to/germany-latest.osm.pbf -backend bdb -workfolder /tmp -output /path/to/outputdir/germany
```

After the conversion has finished, the data in the output directory looks like this:

```bash
$ ls -l /path/to/outputdir/germany
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki 7520947178 Apr 21 23:18 BUILDING
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki 3850151857 Apr 21 23:18 ROAD
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki   26251267 Apr 21 23:18 TRAFFIC_SIGNAL
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki  184394469 Apr 21 23:18 TREE
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki  159681265 Apr 21 23:18 WATER
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nidzwetzki nidzwetzki   82794367 Apr 21 23:18 WOOD
```

The input is split up into multiple files and converted into GeoJSON. The file 'BUILDING' (20,828,427 objects) contains all buildings in Germany; the file 'TREE' contains all trees (1,118,516 objects) of Germany.

##  Importing Data
The file 'TREE' is now imported into BBoxDB. However, a 2-dimensional distribution group needs to be created first. The distribution group in this example is called '2_testgroup'. The data of the trees will be stored in the table '2_testgroup_germanytree'.

The tasks can be accomplished with the following two commands:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action create_dgroup -dgroup 2_testgroup -replicationfactor 2
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action create_table -table 2_testgroup_germanytree
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action import -file /path/to/TREE -format geojson -table 2_testgroup_germanytree
```

## Fetching Data
Now, the stored data can be accessed. The data importer uses a consecutive number for each object. Therefore, to fetch the object with the key '120', the following command can be used:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_germanytree -key 120

Connecting to BBoxDB cluster... [Established]
Executing key query..
Key 120, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 52.546123300000005 high: 52.546123300000005, dimension 1 low: 13.350283200000002 high: 13.350283200000002], value={"geometry":{"coordinates":[52.546123300000005,13.350283200000002],"type":"Point"},"id":405400527,"type":"Feature","properties":{"natural":"tree","leaf_cycle":"deciduous","leaf_type":"broadleaved"}}, version timestamp=1493788229600008
Query done
```

The tuple is loaded from BBoxDB and printed on the console. The Key, the Bounding Box and the GeoJSON data (the value) of the tuple are printed. The area around the Alexanderplatz can be roughly expressed by a square with the following coordinates: 13.410, 52.520 for the lower left corner and 13.415, 52.525 for the upper right corner. The following command can be used, to fetch all trees, which lie inside of the square:

```bash
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_germanytree -bbox 13.410:52.520:13.415:52.525

[...]
Key 37587, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 52.4558036 high: 52.4558036, dimension 1 low: 13.4450991 high: 13.4450991], value={"geometry":{"coordinates":[52.4558036,13.4450991],"type":"Point"},"id":3451433771,"type":"Feature","properties":{"natural":"tree","leaf_cycle":"deciduous","leaf_type":"broadleaved"}}, version timestamp=1493788236276020

Key 37589, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 52.455847000000006 high: 52.455847000000006, dimension 1 low: 13.446559800000001 high: 13.446559800000001], value={"geometry":{"coordinates":[52.455847000000006,13.446559800000001],"type":"Point"},"id":3451433775,"type":"Feature","properties":{"natural":"tree","leaf_cycle":"deciduous","leaf_type":"broadleaved"}}, version timestamp=1493788236276024
Query done
```

## Viewing the Data Distribution

BBoxDB distributes the data of a distribution group across multiple systems. Depending on the configuration, the imported data could be already spread across several systems. This can be viewed via CLI or via GUI.

### Via the Command Line Interface (CLI)

To view how the data of the distribution group 2_testgroup is spread, the following command can be used:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action show_dgroup -dgroup 2_testgroup

Region 0, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 [min,max], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=SPLIT, Systems=[192.168.1.183:50505, 192.168.1.191:50505]

Region 1, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 [min,52.5145621], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=ACTIVE, Systems=[192.168.1.189:50505, 192.168.1.192:50505]

Region 2, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 (52.5145621,max], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=ACTIVE, Systems=[192.168.1.181:50505, 192.168.1.199:50505]

[....]
```

It can be seen, that the data of the region 0 is split. Region 1 stores the data that belongs to the bounding box Dimension:0 [min,52.5145621], Dimension:1 [min,max]. Region 2 stores the remaining data. The  region 1 is stored on the systems '192.168.1.189:50505, 192.168.1.192:50505' the region 2 is stored on the systems '192.168.1.181:50505, 192.168.1.199:50505'.

### Via the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
To use the GUI, please use the following command:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/gui.sh
```

<p><img src="/bboxdb/images/bboxdb_gui1.jpg" width="400"></p>

After connecting to BBoxDB, the GUI shows all discovered distribution groups on the left side. On the bottom, all known BBoxDB-nodes and their state are shown. In the middle of the GUI, the K-D Tree of the distribution group is printed. For two-dimensional distribution groups which work with WGS84 coordinates, an overlay for OpenStreetMap data can be displayed.

# An example with duplicate keys
BBoxDB can store a history for each tuple. The history stores a certain amount of old values for each tuple. To use this function, the corresponding table must be allowed to contain duplicates for keys. To prevent the tables from becoming infinitely large, BBoxDB can automatically delete old tuples. This is done, when more then a certain amount of _versions_ for a key contained in the table or then the tuples become older than a certain amount of time (_time to live_).

In the following example, a table is created that contains up to three versions for a certain key:
```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action create_dgroup -dgroup 2_testgroup -replicationfactor 1
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action create_table -table 2_testgroup_data -duplicates true -versions 3
```
Now five versions for the key are inserted with the values _value1_, _value2_, _value3_, _value4_ and _value5_:
```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action insert -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 -bbox 1:2:1:2 -value value1
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action insert -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 -bbox 1:2:1:2 -value value2
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action insert -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 -bbox 1:2:1:2 -value value3
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action insert -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 -bbox 1:2:1:2 -value value4
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action insert -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 -bbox 1:2:1:2 -value value5
```

The key query retuns the three most recent versions for the key:
```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 
Connecting to BBoxDB cluster... [Established]
Executing key query..
Key key1, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 1.0 high: 2.0, dimension 1 low: 1.0 high: 2.0], value=value3, version timestamp=1509699605215000
Key key1, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 1.0 high: 2.0, dimension 1 low: 1.0 high: 2.0], value=value4, version timestamp=1509699607483000
Key key1, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 1.0 high: 2.0, dimension 1 low: 1.0 high: 2.0], value=value5, version timestamp=1509699609644000
Query done
```

Now, the tuple for the key is deleted and the key query is executed again. It can be seen that there are still three versions stored for this key. The version with the value "value3" has been removed and a new version (which says that the tuple was deleted) has been added.

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_data -key key1 
Connecting to BBoxDB cluster... [Established]
Executing key query..
Key key1, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 1.0 high: 2.0, dimension 1 low: 1.0 high: 2.0], value=value4, version timestamp=1509699607483000
Key key1, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 1.0 high: 2.0, dimension 1 low: 1.0 high: 2.0], value=value5, version timestamp=1509699609644000
Key key1, DELETED, version timestamp=1509703784058000
Query done
```
