# An Example with OpenStreetmap Data
This section covers an example to demonstrate the basic functionality of BBoxDB. Data of the OpenStreetmap project is fechted, converted and imported into a table. Then, some queries are executed on this data set. In this example, the spatial data of the German capital (Berlin) is used. Then, all trees around the famous [Alexanderplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz) (a public square in Berlin) are fetched.

## Downloading and Converting Data
The first step is to download and to convert the data set. The data is stored in a format called 'Protocolbuffer Binary Format'. BBoxDB ships with a converter that converts this format into GeoJSON. You will find more details about the data converter [here](/bboxdb/tools/converter.html).

The conversion can be executed with the following commands:
```bash
$ wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf
$ cd $BBOXDB_HOME
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/osm_data_conveter.sh -input /path/to/berlin-latest.osm.pbf -backend bdb -workfolder /tmp -output /path/to/outputdir/berlin
```

After the conversion has finished, the data in the output direcotry looks like this:

```bash
$ ls -l /path/to/outputdir/berlin
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin 141856254 May  3 06:43 BUILDING
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin  47669095 May  3 06:43 ROAD
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin   1476228 May  3 06:43 TRAFFIC_SIGNAL
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin  21071489 May  3 06:43 TREE
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin    988850 May  3 06:43 WATER
-rw-r--r-- 1 nidzwetzki psadmin    643349 May  3 06:43 WOOD
```

The input is split up into multiple files and converted into GeoJSON. The file 'BUILDING' (359065 objects) contains all buildings in Berlin; the file 'TREE' contains all trees (109703 objects) of Berlin.

##  Importing Data
The file 'TREE' is now imported into BBoxDB. However, a 2-dimensional distribution group needs to be created first. The distribution group in this example is called '2_testgroup'. The data of the trees will be stored in the table '2_testgroup_berlintree'.

Both tasks can be accomplished with the following two commands:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action create_dgroup -dgroup 2_testgroup -replicationfactor 2
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action import -file /path/to/TREE -format geojson -table 2_testgroup_berlintree
```

## Fetching Data
Now, the stored data can be accessed. The data importer uses a consecutive number for each object. Therefore, to fetch the object with the key '120', the following command can be used:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_berlintree -key 120

Connecting to BBoxDB cluster... [Established]
Executing key query..
Key 120, BoundingBox=BoundingBox [dimensions=2, dimension 0 low: 52.546123300000005 high: 52.546123300000005, dimension 1 low: 13.350283200000002 high: 13.350283200000002], value={"geometry":{"coordinates":[52.546123300000005,13.350283200000002],"type":"Point"},"id":405400527,"type":"Feature","properties":{"natural":"tree","leaf_cycle":"deciduous","leaf_type":"broadleaved"}}, version timestamp=1493788229600008
Query done
```

The tuple is loaded from BBoxDB and printed on the console. The Key, the Bounding Box and the GeoJSON data (the value) of the tuple are printed. The area around the Alexanderplatz can be roughly expressed by a square with the following coordinates: 13.410, 52.520 for the lower left corner and 13.415, 52.525 for the upper right corner. The following command can be used, to fetch all trees, which lie inside of the square:

```bash
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action query -table 2_testgroup_berlintree -bbox 13.410:52.520:13.415:52.525

[...]

## Viewing the Data Distribution

BBoxDB distributes the data of a distribution group across multiple systems. Depending on the configuration, the imported data could be already spread across several systems. This can be viewed via CLI or via GUI.

### Commandline (CLI)

To view how the data of the distribution group 2_testgroup is spread, the following command can be used:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/cli.sh -action show_dgroup -dgroup 2_testgroup

Region 0, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 [min,max], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=SPLIT, Systems=[192.168.1.183:50505, 192.168.1.191:50505]

Region 1, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 [min,52.5145621], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=ACTIVE, Systems=[192.168.1.189:50505, 192.168.1.192:50505]

Region 2, Bounding Box=Dimension:0 (52.5145621,max], Dimension:1 [min,max], State=ACTIVE, Systems=[192.168.1.181:50505, 192.168.1.199:50505]
```

It can be seen, that the data of the region 0 is split. Region 1 stores the data that belongs to the bounding box Dimension:0 [min,52.5145621], Dimension:1 [min,max]. Region 2 stores the remaining data. The  region 1 is stored on the systems '192.168.1.189:50505, 192.168.1.192:50505' the region 1 is stored on the systems '192.168.1.181:50505, 192.168.1.199:50505'.

### The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
To use the GUI, please use the following command:

```bash
$ $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/gui.sh
```

<p><img src="/bboxdb/images/bboxdb_gui1.jpg" width="400"></p>

After connecting to BBoxDB, the GUI shows all discovered distribution groups on the left side. On the bottom, all known BBoxDB-nodes and their state are shown. In the middle of the GUI, the K-D Tree of the distribution group is printed. For two-dimensional distribution groups which work with WGS84 coordinates, an overlay for OpenStreetMap data can be displayed.
